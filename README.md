## Inspiration

TraVit was inspired by the need for a convenient and organized way to locate the shuttle buses in the VIT campus.The idea waas then expanded to cabs and incorporating the carpooling servies in our app too.

## What It Does

TraVit helps to locate the positioning of shuttle buses.It will also to be expanded to include car-pooling options to  help users group together for a journey easily.

## How It's Built

TraVit is meticulously crafted using modern mobile application development technologies. It leverages the power of Jetpack Compose, Google Maps API, and Kotlin programming language, all brought together within the Android Studio environment.

## Challenges You Ran Into

While building TraVit, we encountered challenges related to intergration of a positionaing system into the app,creating a database of users and contructing an IoT device to be used to know the location of shuttle.

## Accomplishments You're Proud Of

We have managed to intergrate Google Maps api into the app and despite lacking 2 technical memebers the app progress was still there along with great designs by the design member in a very short amount of time. 

## What You Learned

During the development of TraVit, we learned about user authentication, real-time location data synchronization. We also gained experience in team collaboration too.

## What's Next for TraVit

Our vision for TraVit's future is ambitious. We plan to expand user customization features, integrate carpooling functionality into the app, and establish partnerships with local cab services and rickshaw unions. Additionally, implementing a secure payment system is on our roadmap.
